# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default using the **Lending Club Loan Dataset**.

## 📊 Project Goals
- Predict high-risk applicants
- Assist lenders in reducing loan default rates
- Provide model interpretability using SHAP

## 📁 Dataset
- Lending Club Loan Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)

## 🧠 Models Used
- LightGBM Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## ⚙️ Techniques
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE
- Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- SHAP analysis for explainability

## 📌 Results
- Feature importance plotted
- SHAP summary bar plot
- Classification reports for both models
